# Python Data Types: Booleans and Comparison

## Introduction
This section covers the boolean data type and comparison operations in Python. Understanding these concepts is crucial for making decisions in your code based on certain conditions.

## Booleans in Python
In Python, a boolean (bool) is a data type that can either be `True` or `False`. Booleans are often the result of comparison operations and are fundamental in conditional statements and loops.

### Example
```python
is_active = True
is_registered = False
```

Here, `is_active` and `is_registered` are boolean variables holding `True` and `False` respectively.

## Comparison Operations
Comparison operations compare two values and return a boolean result: either `True` or `False`.

### Types of Comparison Operators
1. **Equal To (`==`)**: Checks if two values are equal.
2. **Not Equal To (`!=`)**: Checks if two values are not equal.
3. **Greater Than (`>`)**: Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.
4. **Less Than (`<`)**: Checks if the left value is less than the right value.
5. **Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`)**: Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.
6. **Less Than or Equal To (`<=`)**: Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.

### Basic Examples
```python
a = 5
b = 3

print(a == b)  # Output: False
print(a != b)  # Output: True
print(a > b)   # Output: True
print(a < b)   # Output: False
print(a >= 5)  # Output: True
print(b <= 2)  # Output: False
```

In these examples, various comparison operations are used to compare `a` and `b`, and the results are boolean values.

## Using Booleans in Conditional Statements
Booleans are especially useful in conditional statements like `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

### Example
```python
if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")
else:
    print("a is not greater than b")
```

This `if` statement checks whether `a` is greater than `b` and executes code based on the boolean result of the comparison.

Understanding booleans and comparison operations is essential for controlling the flow of a Python program, allowing for decision-making and branching paths based on certain conditions.
