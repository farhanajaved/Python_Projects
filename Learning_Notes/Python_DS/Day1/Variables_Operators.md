# Python Variables and Operators Tutorial

## Introduction
This section provides a basic tutorial on variables and operators in Python, which are fundamental concepts in programming. Understanding these will help you grasp how to store data and perform operations on it in Python.

## Variables in Python
Variables in Python are like containers for storing data values. Python is dynamic, so a variable is created when you assign it a value and no explicit declaration is needed.

### Example
```python
x = 5
name = "Alice"
```

In this example, `x` is a variable holding the integer `5`, and `name` is a variable storing the string `"Alice"`.

### Rules for Python Variables
1. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
2. They must start with a letter or an underscore.
3. Variables are case-sensitive (`myVar`, `myvar`, and `MyVar` are different).
4. Reserved words (like `if`, `else`, `class`, etc.) can't be used as variable names.

## Operators in Python
Operators are special symbols that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. The value the operator operates on is called the operand.

### Types of Operators
1. **Arithmetic Operators**
   - `+` Addition (e.g., `a + b`)
   - `-` Subtraction (e.g., `a - b`)
   - `*` Multiplication (e.g., `a * b`)
   - `/` Division (e.g., `a / b`)
   - `%` Modulus (e.g., `a % b`)
   - `**` Exponent (e.g., `a ** b`)
   - `//` Floor division (e.g., `a // b`)

2. **Assignment Operators**
   - `=` (e.g., `x = 5`)
   - `+=` (e.g., `x += 5` is equivalent to `x = x + 5`)
   - `-=` (e.g., `x -= 5` is equivalent to `x = x - 5`)
   - Similarly for `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `//=`, `**=`, etc.

3. **Comparison Operators**
   - `==` Equal to
   - `!=` Not equal to
   - `>` Greater than
   - `<` Less than
   - `>=` Greater than or equal to
   - `<=` Less than or equal to

4. **Logical Operators**
   - `and` (True if both statements are true)
   - `or` (True if one of the statements is true)
   - `not` (Reverse the result)

### Basic Examples
```python
# Arithmetic Operators
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Output: 13
print(a * b)  # Output: 30
print(a / b)  # Output: 3.333...

# Assignment Operators
a += 5       # Equivalent to a = a + 5
print(a)     # Output: 15

# Comparison Operators
print(a == b)  # Output: False

# Logical Operators
print(a > b and b > 1)  # Output: True
```
